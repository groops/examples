# Groops

This is a set of sample applications used for comparing different web app frameworks. It is a simple, on-demand virtual meeting room application. The goal is to provide canonical examples of both server-side and client-side components, in different technologies, that can be mixed and matched through a common API.

This is an experimental project for the Austin [Bleeding Edge Web](http://edgeatx.github.io/) meetup.

## Specs
