# Groops

This is a set of sample applications used for comparing different web app frameworks. It is a simple, on-demand virtual meeting room application. The goal is to provide canonical examples of both server-side and client-side components, in different technologies, that can be mixed and matched through a common API.

This is an experimental project for the Austin [Bleeding Edge Web](http://edgeatx.github.io/) meetup.

## Specs

To implement the Groops app in your technology of choice, please check out the [specs](https://github.com/groops/examples/wiki/Application-Specs) as your starting point.  The reference back-end implementation is built in [Node + Express](https://github.com/groops/examples/tree/master/backend/node-express).

We'll have more examples soon. Anyone is free to contribute &mdash; **PR's always welcome!**
